Files needed to run the results from:

Ureta et al. 2021. Greendlandâ€™s thaw pushes the biodiversity crisis (under review)

The code directory contains R scripts to perform the analyses and plot the results (NOTE: some of the resulting plots were edited in Adobe Illustrator to obtain the final figures).
